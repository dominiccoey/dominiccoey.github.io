I'm a research scientist on the [Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/) team at Facebook, where I lead the Economic Research team. I'm interested in causal inference broadly, in both large-scale experimental and observational settings, and using insights from economic theory to inform strategy and decision-making. My research has included work on empirical Bayesian shrinkage estimators and experiment splitting, imperfect treatment assignment, experimentation in markets, and the empirical analysis of auctions.
