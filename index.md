I'm a Director and research scientist on the [Central Applied Science](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/) team at Meta, where I lead the Economics, Algorithms and Optimization group. I'm interested in causal inference broadly, in both large-scale experimental and observational settings, and using insights from economic theory to inform strategy and decision-making. My research has included work on variance reduction, empirical Bayesian shrinkage estimators and experiment splitting, imperfect treatment assignment, and experimentation in markets.

I received a PhD in Economics from Stanford, a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE, and a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Oxford.
